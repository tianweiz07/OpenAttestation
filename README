	OpenAttestation project is to provide SDK, Software Development Kit, to add cloud management tools with capability of establishing hosts integrity information by remotely retrieving and verifying Hosts' integrity with TPM quote.

	The SDK is expected to be integrated, and enhanced with security features, into 3rd party cloud management software, and distributed by ISV to cloud providers

	The integrated software is hosted and operated by cloud service providers

	For further details, please read docucuments in ~/docs
